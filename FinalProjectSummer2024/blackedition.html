                        Nintendo's first handheld multi-game system evolving from the Game and
                        Watch handheld electronic games. The Game Boy featured some improvements over
                        the Game and Watch handhelds mainly by offering a common, modular platform for different games by making use of
                        both with swappable cartridge based games and a dot matrix screen instead of fixed image graphics.
