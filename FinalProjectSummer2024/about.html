      <div class="why">
          <h2>The Why</h2>
          <p>With great love for old school video games and consoles we decided to open a store that will help other people who grew up in the 90s to find  gaming consoles like they had back in the day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="original">
          <h2>100% Original</h2>
          <p>No fakes or modded products are allowed here. The number of counterfeit products being produced is increasing, making them harder to distinguish over time. Just like our memories, we desire our old games to be authentic, genuine, and completely original. That's why our experts are thoroughly familiar with every game and console ever made.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="customer">
          <h2>Outstanding Customer Service</h2>
          <p>Need assistance identifying which game is compatible with which system, connecting your console to your television, or just want to chat with knowledgeable retro gaming enthusiasts? Feel free to reach out to us by phone, email, or message for support. We know online purchases can be challenging, so we strive to prevent issues before they arise. If any problems do occur, we'll work diligently to resolve them and ensure they don't happen again.</p>
